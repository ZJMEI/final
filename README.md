- I'm going to build a wikipedia, maybe mainly about warships during the World War II(Because I am interested in the game World of Warships). It will contain the basic information about the warships, some famous captain or admiral, and also some famous event in the history.
- User may modify item only if they have the access, but they will be free to comment.
- The database will contain mainly 5(or 6) parts:
  *Warship(or maybe two model, one for warship class and one for warship)
  *Person(captain)
  *Event
  *Service (captain - warship)
  *Enrolled (warship - event)
  *User
